# 👋 Thanks for stopping by! 

Welcome to my GitHub profile</br>
My name is Eleandro, but you can call me "ePav-dev".</br>I'm passionate about research and practice, always seeking to learn and improve my skills.</br>

**Self description:** I'm Brazilian, with fair skin, brown eyes, a beard, and wavy brown hair. No tattoos or glasses here. I'm a bit on the heavier side, but that's just because I'm overflowing with beauty, I guess. 😄


## About Me
⚡ *I'm an engineer, a dad, and a ham radio enthusiast who loves to chat over a good cup of coffee. Think of me as a multitasking wizard who can fix your gadgets, tell dad jokes, and discuss the latest radio frequencies—all while sipping on a perfectly brewed espresso. ☕🔧📻*
